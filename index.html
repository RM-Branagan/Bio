      <p><em>The Founder of <strong><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/pineapple-upsidedown-cake">Pineapples and Cake</a></strong>.</em></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Background</strong>: I suppose this is where I discuss my beginnings and what made me. I was born in 1968 or 1995 and lived right next door to the wastes <br>
        in a era that consisted of beetles and nuclear fallout. The Cuban Missle Crisis had turned hot as a trot when a third-party intervened, a party everyone did <br>
        and didn't expect. If only the people of Earth, then, had realise that you reap what you sow, especially if you're poor, and when the banks blew up in hellfire <br>
        the only worthwhile trade was food, water and shelter. The history books tell us the people responsible for this rather tragic was the pineapples.
      <br>
      <br>
        The 1950s was an incredibly scary time for pineapples as they had only recently gained sentience and yet could not yet gain the vocal cords <br>
        to scream as they were lovingly chomped on by housewives and farmers and the working joe. Only Tiffany Wallis, the dumbest kid in school, could save them.</br>
        So, she enacted a plan, a plan in which I would by become Emperor of the Americas and the Pinapples could be spared. As the for the cakes, who also <br>
        became sentient during this time... well, frankly, my friends, nobody gave a damn and continued to eat them
      <br>
      <br>
        The thing is, I have long suspected that the cakes found their revenge in other ways...

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Academy of Academies</li>
      <li>The Fobberworm College for Uncolonialistic Colonialism</li>
      <li>The Royal Academy for Poor People</li>
      <li>The Electoral College (not that one, maybe)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are few examples of where I could have been educated as it's possible that I was educated at some point, but I cannot possibly comment on that.<br>
       You see I could also have may gone to Oxford and Cambridge at the same time as well. Before that, of course, or perhaps, Groton or the Imperial Academy <br>
       for Snobbers and Fobbers, but we shall never know as a most infamouse person of interest in a marmalade theft was responsible for the single atomic blast <br>
       that wiped out France and New York while missing everywhere else somehow except Daniel Radcliffe and Mace Windu who were in London visiting the bank</p>
